9am-4:30

spring security spring dataflow kafka
frontend sometimes, backend sometimes, we do rotate
xp - agile methodology no fixed sprint. same standup, retro.

point stories, we dont do pre-plan 2 weeks whatever,
whatever we can get done as quickly as possible deploy whenever we need to.

straightforward - lingo you've been dealing with REST call, recieve this, validate this, put in database, return error mesasges
heavy stuff- products getting more complex
standard tech stack ? you may also hit a db2 database and hit a oracle database same time
might have to ssh through java program and unzip folders, files, send to mainframe

processing difficulties with flow, communicating with another system, 
another db another enpoint. likely some extensive json manipulation.

Peer programming - pairing together 1 imac computer, 2 keyboard, 2 mouse
Standup, work with negineer until 4:30
1 coding, 1 suggestions (challenging upholding)
Writing, deploying, invited into code reviews
Code reviews every day all the way through the whole weeks
REtros on Fridays
Everything similar to SCRUM
We do have product managers.
No QA.
We do have designers, just need to implement what they give.
